# Texture-Pack-Randomizer
## A fun experiment that randomly swaps block, item, and particle effect textures in Minecraft.

### The result is.... chaotic.
**It does make for a funny joke, though I can't recommend really playing the game with this texture pack...**


# Usage:
## Use My Texture Pack
- If you want to play with the texture pack I generated, navigate to ```/examples```, and download ```random_texture_pack.zip```
## Compile and generate a pack on your own
- Under Releases, download the "Texture-Pack-Generator.zip" file.
- Extract the file
- Run ```javac Main.java```
- Run ```java Main```
- Select "assets", "pack.mcmeta", and "pack.png"
- Compress the files into a ```.zip``` file.
### Thats it! The compressed file can be used as a texture pack in (Java) Minecraft.
