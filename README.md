# Texture-Pack-Randomizer
This program was made as a fun experiment to see what would happen if you randomly swap block textures in Minecraft.
![Example 1](https://github.com/Trevin-Small/Texture-Pack-Randomizer/blob/main/examples/wtf.png)
![Example 2](https://github.com/Trevin-Small/Texture-Pack-Randomizer/blob/main/examples/underwater.png)
### As you can see, the result is.... chaotic.
The game is nearly unplayable like this ðŸ˜‚  
It does make for a funny joke, though I can't recommend attempting to beat the game with this texture pack...
